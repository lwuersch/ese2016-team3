# Meetings

## 19.20.2016

### Traktanden

*First off:* From **November 2nd** on, our customer meeting will take place on **Wednesdays 1.30 pm**.

#### GUI Mockups

*Start screen:*

- Splash screen is unnecessary
- Should be a *MUST SEE* page
- Should feature ads from premium user (a premium user can pay to be displayed on the start page)

*Other:*

- Tabs are a good option, auctions will *NOT* be a separate tab
- User needs to be able to check properties for sale *WITHOUT* having to to look at auctions (check box options)


#### Name Ideas 

Name should be:

- Metaphorical (e.g. compass) 
- Just one name (one component) 
- something catchy

#### Search Criteria and Attributes for/of Properties 

**NOT** necessary from current list:

- Garden 
- Cellar 
- Attic 
- Kinderfreundlichkeit etc.
- Washing machine
- Dishwasher only for renting

**TO ADD** to current list:

- Distance to public transport, shopping schools should be shown in 100 m steps (until 1000)
- Type of infrastructure for TV and internet (cable, etc.)
- Floor level for appartments
- Elevator

#### Bootstrap? Yes/No

- Good idea but would be better if we found a template in jsp
- Mix of bootstrap and spring

#### Which features are most important for v2.0?

**1. Priority**

- Creation of premium and normal users (premium users pay, normal users don't)
- Normal user can upgrade account
- Paying mechanisms should be implemented

**2. Priority**

- The new features, new attributes and their search, alerts, display etc.

Auctions can be implemented later
